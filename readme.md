Developed a self driving car visualizer using python, pytorch, kivy.
The algorithm works on Bellman Equation for Q-Learning.

Game starts with a car having three sensors to detect the obstacle in its journey from bottom left to top right and vice-versa. User can create it own obstacle using mouse to draw road and the car will learn on its own to reach its desired destination.
